      <h2>1. UVSS (Under Vehicle Surveillance System)</h2>
      <p>This cutting-edge surveillance system is designed for military and high-security zones. It features AI-powered image analysis, solar/tree-powered cameras, and real-time Wi-Fi data transmission. Already deployed at the Indian Army base in Navshera, J&K, it captures under-vehicle images and number plates of incoming trucks and compares them on return to detect foreign objects or threats such as mines or hidden weapons. The system can also be customized for use at malls and government buildings.</p>
